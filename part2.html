    <div id="sample1" class="sample">
      <p>People mainly use smartphones for social media, gaming, and short videos. The problem is that excessive screen time often causes eye strain, sleep issues, and weaker social interactions. It can even lower productivity because people get easily distracted. Personally, I think the best solution is to set daily limits or use apps that remind us to take breaks. This way, technology stays helpful rather than harmful.</p>
